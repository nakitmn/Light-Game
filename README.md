# Light-Game

# Gameplay video: https://youtu.be/6KvEXDtkp4w

My first own game.
There is no sence and any mechanics. It's just a prototype of the light's behaviour.
Here you can move animated character, turn off/on light in rooms, choose one of the 4 light behaviors.

There are 4 light behaviours in the game:
1. Default mode - light just can be turned on/off by player, using 'E' keybutton.
2. Sensore mode - light becomes turned on if the player is moving in the room. Light is enabled for 10 game minutes.
3. Guests mode - all house lights become turned on and the music is playing.
4. Outside mode - random light becomes turned on for 30 game minutes then it turns off.

There is also a time in the game and a slider for changing the speed of the time.
